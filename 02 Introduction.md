# INTRODUCTION

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for: web development (server-side),software development,mathematics,system scripting.
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purposes.

Another thing to know is that Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. 
It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike as it is very easy to learn and can be understood without much difficulty.
Python for Machine Learning and data analysis:
Data analysis and machine learning
Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks.

Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.

# WHY PYTHON IS POPULAR?

Python is popular for a number of reasons.
It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand.
It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.
It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.
It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.
Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.
Python has a large and active community that contributes to Python’s pool of modules and libraries, and acts as a helpful resource for other programmers. The vast support community means that if coders run into a stumbling block, finding a solution is relatively easy; somebody is bound to have encountered the same problem before.
