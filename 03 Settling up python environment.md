# Coding Environment

Before writing and executing Python code, you need a suitable environment. While shells can run Python scripts, they lack documentation space. Several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are available for Python development. The top 5 include:

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. PyCharm
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Spyder
5. Atom

These IDEs offer various features like code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities, catering to different preferences and workflows. For this discussion, we'll focus on Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook.

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   Visual Studio Code is a versatile IDE supporting multiple languages, including Python. It provides intelligent code completion, built-in debugging tools, and extensive extensions, enhancing the Python development experience.

2. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   Jupyter Notebook allows you to create and share live code, equations, visualizations, and text. It's ideal for machine learning, data exploration, and visualization, offering an interactive environment for experimenting with code and sharing analyses.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is a free, lightweight source code editor customizable through extensions, supporting various programming needs. Key features include:

1. **Editors Feature:**
   With a small installation footprint, VS Code starts up quickly, offering a fast, responsive editing experience.

2. **IDEs Feature:**
   Supporting debugging tools, source control integration, and numerous programming languages, VS Code combines the benefits of both code editors and IDEs.

3. **Versatile:**
   Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

4. **Explorer:**
   This feature allows you to create, save, find, and open files and folders without switching to a file manager application.

5. **Extensibility:**
   Additional features and functionality can be added beyond the initial download, including support for other languages, frameworks, themes, and tools.

## Installing and Configuring Visual Studio Code for Python Development

1. **Check Python Installation:**
   Open the command prompt and type either "python --version" or "py --version." If you see "Python 3.x," it's installed. If not, follow the installation guide [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for the latest version.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   If not already installed, download and install VS Code. Then, install the Python extension in VS Code. Detailed procedures can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/python-install-vscode).
